### ** MuscleMemoryV2 **

## Inspiration
Our inspiration was a hands-free experience when your hands are full.

## What it does
It uses the Myo armband C++ library and the BOSE soundtouch control API to utilize custom gestures and apply them to soundtouch controls.

## How we built it
We utilized C++ and C libraries supported by Myo and applied them through php functions hosted through an apache server.

## Challenges we ran into
Working on something that we had one input device for and needed an update of code every iteration to communicate effectively made it difficult to work together. We ended up trio programming/testing/debugging on one computer. 
Only one person in our group knew C, C++, and PHP so for us to utilize these languages the other two had to successfully understand what we were navigating.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully finished a hackathon project as a team. Utilizing our aspects of software development we each contributed to building something useful. 
## What we learned
Teamwork, communication, and cross-interfacing that is open from many locations is important to testing.
## What's next for MuscleMusic
Open source application on the Myo Marketplace armband page, contributing to the BOSE soundtouch controls when applied to the same wifi network.
